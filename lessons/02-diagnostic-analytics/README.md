# Lesson 02: Diagnostic Analytics — Diagnosing Success

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Apply the same diagnostic framework to positive trends
- Identify growth drivers through segmentation
- Analyze behavioral patterns (promo usage, time of day)
- Connect multiple signals to form a complete story
- Formulate actionable recommendations from data insights

## The Scenario

You're still the data analyst at **Campus Bites**. After fixing the late-night delivery issue (from Lesson 01), the CEO has great news:

> "Revenue is up 33% this month! What's working — and how do we do more of it?"

Your mission: Use SQL to identify what drove the growth and recommend how to replicate it.

## Files in This Lesson

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [lesson-02-worksheet.sql](lesson-02-worksheet.sql) | SQL exercises to complete during class (open in DBeaver) |

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lesson 01 (database connection already set up)
- Comfortable with GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, and basic aggregations

## Database Connection

Same as Lesson 01:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Host | db.isba.co |
| Port | 3306 |
| Database | campus_bites |
| Username | student |
| Password | learn_sql |

## Key Concepts

### Same Framework, Different Question

| Lesson 01 | Lesson 02 |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Why did orders DROP?" | "Why did revenue GROW?" |
| Find the problem | Find the opportunity |
| Fix the issue | Exploit the success |
| Defensive analytics | Offensive analytics |

### The Framework Works Both Ways

1. **Define**: What's the question? (Problem OR opportunity)
2. **Collect**: Get the right data
3. **Analyze**: Descriptive → Diagnostic
4. **Communicate**: Insight with recommendation
5. **Act**: Implement the decision
